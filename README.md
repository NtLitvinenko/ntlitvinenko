### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am NTLDev (or ntlitvinenko)
Do you know me?
If no check my GH repos!:
https://github.com/NtLitvinenko/CRS (Github repo about console rendering)
https://github.com/NtLitvinenko/GDino_and_Arduino (Github repo about game with LCD 1602 on arduino)

I'm learning (or try to learning) C++, âœ¨OpenGLâœ¨
I'm looking for help for my projects (you'r welcome!)
Fun fact(s): I am live in Novosibirsk.
